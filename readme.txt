Trashcan Reminder 2.0
Homey will remind you to put the trash out! You can do this by providing a postal code, house number (currently NL/BE only).

Supported Cities
A lot of cities are supported with this trashcan reminder. If your city is not supported you can always add your schedule manually.

Tags
There are three global tags available. The tags can be configured trough the settings page. The tags represent the trash that is collected today, tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.
If you want to create a flow that notifies you what type of trash is collected today, use the "collected today" tag.
If you want to create a flow that notifies you what type of trash is collected tomorrow, use the "collected tomorrow" tag.
If you want to create a flow that notifies you what type of trash is collected the day after tomorrow, use the "collected day after tomorrow" tag.
Plase note that the tags are independent from the "What type of trash is collected on << day >>" card available in the "and" column.
