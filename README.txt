Homey will remind you to put the trash out! You can do this by providing a postal code, house number and country (NL/BE).

A lot of cities are supported with this trashcan reminder. If your city is not supported you can always add your schedule manually. You can add new cities yourself, but requests to add new cities aren't honoured. If you wish to contribute to the project (for example by adding support for a city). I would advise you to take a look at [this explanation](https://github.com/robertraaijmakers/com.trashchecker/tree/master/developers).

Supported Cards
There is one card that you can place in the "and" column. The card lets you check whether or not trash is collected either today, tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. The type of trash that is checked for can be set to a specific one, or to 'any' to include all types.

Supported Speech / Chat
You can ask Homey four type of questions regarding your waste collection:
- When is the green container collected?
- What is collected next monday?
- Is the residual waste collected this friday?
- Which type of trash is collected next?

Tags
There is one global tag available that you can set dynamically via the settings. This tag will show the value belonging to the trash type(s) that are collected.
